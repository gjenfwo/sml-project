  description: |
    This resource describes a sensed or actuated Temperature value.
    The temperature describes the current value measured.
    The units is a single value that is one of C, F or K.
    It provides the unit of measurement for the temperature value.
    It is a read-only value that is provided by the server.
    If the units Property is missing the default is Celsius [C].
    The range is an array with min,max values for this temperature on this device.
    If no range is provided the default is +/- MAXINT.

  get:
    description: |
      Retrieves the current temperature value.
      A client can specify the units for the requested temperature by use of a query parameter.
      If no query parameter is provided the server provides its default measure or set value.

          This response is generated by the OIC Server when the client sends:
            A retrieve with q queryParameter indicating a unit that the server does not support.
          The server responds with the current resource representation including the
          units property illustrating the supported units and the error.

      If a unit is included and the server does not support the unit indictaed the request will fail.
      If the units are omitted value is taken to be in C.
