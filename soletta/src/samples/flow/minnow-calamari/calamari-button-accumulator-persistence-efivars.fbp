# This example is just a variation of
# calamari-button-accumulator-persistence.fbp.
#
# It showcases persistence usage. By clicking on Buttons 1 & 2,
# one can increase/decrease a counter, that is displayed on 7 seg display.
# Each change is also persisted to Calamari EFIVARS, so this sample will, on
# a second run, remembers counter last value.

btn2(Button2)
accumulator(int/accumulator:send_initial_packet=false,setup_value=min:0|max:15|step:1)
seg(SevenSegments)
persistence(persistence/int:storage="efivars",name="accumulated",default_value=0)

persistence OUT -> SET accumulator
persistence OUT -> VALUE seg

btn1 OUT -> IN _(boolean/filter) TRUE -> INC accumulator
btn2 OUT -> IN _(boolean/filter) TRUE -> DEC accumulator

accumulator OUT -> IN persistence
