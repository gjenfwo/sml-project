# This sample exemplifies the ThingSpeak Talkback feature usage.
#
# TalkBack enables any device to act on queued commands.
#
# So in this example we'll have a device
# used to identify a person and send a command to another device, the
# smart lock, to open.
#
# Here we'll simulate the first device as a single keyboard key and
# it will add the command "OPEN" to the queue every time it's pressed
# (key 'a').
# It also prints to the console the submitted command.
#
# Usage: ./thingspeak-talkback-identify.fbp
#
# On other process you may run thingspeak-talkback-smart-lock.fbp
# to consume these commands.
#
# Register at https://thingspeak.com or use another server (and
# update node type options).
#
# There you should create a new Talkback. You need the talkback
# id (not the name) and the API Key. Use these values as
# options for talkback_add and talkback_execute nodes.
#
# You'll be able to see it through the Thingspeak web interface as well,
# if you want.


# TODO wouldn't be better to accept API_KEY and ID through input ports?
#talkback_id(app/argv:index=1)
#api_key(app/argv:index=2)
