This is a basic example of how to use systemd to limit system calls access
of given process.

It contains three different services, one is resposible for start the fb-runner and
runs runs the socket-string-writer.fbp, another service is responsible to run
socket-string-reader.fbp and the last one is service that will fail to run
socket-string-reader.fbp because the process is not allowed to use the connect() syscall.

To test it, just copy those three services for the systemd service's dir and run:

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start unix-socket-writer
systemctl start unix-socket-reader
systemctl start unix-socket-reader-fail

It's possible to check the result using journalctl -r
